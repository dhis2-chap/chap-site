Several spatio-temporal models have been developed for forecasting incidence of vector- and water-borne diseases like malaria, dengue and cholera. </p> <p>While these approaches often employ sophisticated statistical modeling and show good predictive accuracy, they require substantial manual effort to develop for each country and disease setting, and are implemented through bespoke software tools that are not integrated with the routine Health Management Information Systems (HMIS), often based on DHIS2, that are used in LMICs for planning, monitoring, and evaluating health program. This makes it challenging to operationalize these tools over longer periods and to scale beyond individual country and disease contexts. </p> <p>While there are potentially useful open-source models available, there is a gap in translating this research into automated, packaged tools. In addition, the majority of LMICs face gaps in the availability of the granular, digitized climate data these models require. The result is that early warning and response systems for climate-sensitive diseases have not reached widespread use in LMICs. </p> <p>To address this gap, the HISP Centre has formed a team of machine learning, software engineering, and information systems experts, led by Geir Kjetil Sandve, to develop Chap (Climate &amp; Health Modeling Platform), a collaborative and open platform for harmonizing climate and health data, as well as importing, training, tuning, assessing, and sharing predictive models for climate-informed disease forecasting. </p>"},{"location":"about/partners/","title":"Partners","text":""},{"location":"about/partners/#building-an-interdisciplinary-network-for-global-and-local-collaboration","title":"Building an interdisciplinary network for global and local collaboration","text":"<p>To provide the interdisciplinary expertise required for this project, the HISP Centre is partnering with subject matter experts from internationally recognized research groups and global health organizations working at the intersection of climate and health.

Up CHAP Core as a Contributor","text":"<p>The following is our recommended setup for creating a development environment when working with CHAP Core as a contributor.</p> <p>If you are an external contributor without write-access to the chap-core repository you will first need to fork the chap-core repository to your own GitHub account.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Start by downloading the latest chap-core <code>master</code> branch to a local folder of your choice, either from the main repository or from your own fork:</p> <pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/dhis2-chap/chap-core.git\n$ cd chap-core\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>If you need to work with and test a specific stable version of CHAP Core codebase, these are stored as version tags. Writing <code>git tag</code> on the commandline will give you a list of the available version. To switch to a desired version, for instance v1.0.3, you can write:</p> <pre><code>git switch tags/v1.0.3\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>If you're a Windows user, read this note about how to simulate a Linux environment using Windows WSL. Before proceeding to the next steps, initiate a wsl session from the commandline:</p> <pre><code>$ wsl\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Install the uv package manager if you don't already have it. The benefit of using <code>uv</code> for the development environment is that it makes installing dependencies much faster.     To read more, check out their documentation.</p> <pre><code>* Fetch and install `uv` from their official website:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n  ```\n\n* After the installation, restart the linux shell (or wsl if you're on windows) in order for the uv command to become available.\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Install a local version of Python along with all the dependencies. Inside the project folder, run:</p> <pre><code>$ uv sync --dev\n</code></pre> <p>Note that <code>uv</code> creates a virtual Python environment with all the required packages for you, so you don\u2019t need to do this manually. This environment exists in the <code>.venv</code> directory.</p> </li> <li> <p>Activate the environment and run the tests to make sure everything is working:</p> <pre><code>$ source .venv/bin/activate\n$ pytest\n</code></pre> <p>We recommend a setup where you can run the tests directly through the IDE you are using (e.g. Vscode or Pycharm). Make sure that your IDE is using the correct Python environment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, if the tests are passing, you should now be connected to the development version of Chap, directly reflecting     any changes you make to the code. Check to ensure that the chap command line interface (CLI) is available in your terminal:</p> <pre><code>  ```bash\n  $ chap --help\n  ```\n</code></pre> </li> </ol> <p>It is also good to see if you can run chap evaluation on an external model. The recommended command is <code>chap eval</code>:</p> <pre><code>chap eval --model-name https://github.com/dhis2-chap/chap_auto_ewars --dataset-csv example_data/laos_subset.csv --output-file eval.nc --backtest-params.n-splits 2\n</code></pre> <p>If the above command runs successfully, an <code>eval.nc</code> file will be generated with the results.</p> <p>Note: The legacy <code>chap evaluate</code> command is deprecated and will be removed in v2.0.</p> <p>You have now successfully setup a development version of the chap-cli tool and you are ready to start developing.

What this means is that the data have both a temporal and spatial reference (i.e. data of disease incidence is available at multiple subsequent time points, for different regions in a country), where observations that are close in time or space are usually considered more likely to be similar. In our case, we also have data both on disease and on various climate variables that may influence disease incidence.</p> <p>Before going into the many challenges of spatiotemporal modelling, we recommend that you get the technical setup in place to allow efficient development and learning for the remainder of this tutorial. Although this can be a bit of a technical nuisance just now, it allows you to run your model on a variety of data inputs with rich evaluation now already, and it allows you to progress efficiently with very few technical wrinkles as the statistical and ML aspects become more advanced. To do this, please follow our minimalist example tutorial, which introduces an extremely oversimplified statistical model (linear regression of immediate climate effects on disease only), but shows you how to get this running in Chap.  This minimalist tutorial is available both as Python and as R code:</p> <ul> <li>Minimalist Example (Python)</li> <li>Minimalist Example (R) </li> </ul>"},{"location":"chap-modeling-platform/external_models/learn_modelling/#evaluating-a-model","title":"Evaluating a model","text":"<p>The purpose of spatiotemporal modelling is to learn generalisable patterns that can be used to reason about unseen regions or about the future. Since our use case is an early warning system, our focus is on the latter, i.e. forecasting disease incidence ahead in time based on historic data for a given region. Therefore, we will focus on evaluating a model through its forecasting skill into the future.</p> <p>A straightforward way to assess a forecasting model is to create and record forecasts for future disease development, wait to see how disease truly develops, and then afterwards compare the observed numbers to what was forecasted. This approach has two main limitations, though:  it requires to wait through the forecast period to see what observations turn out to be it only shows the prediction skill of the forecast model at a single snapshot in time - leaving a large uncertainty on how a system may be expected to behave if used to forecast new future periods. </p> <p>A popular and powerful alternative is thus to perform what is called backtesting or hindcasting: one pretends to be at a past point in time, providing a model exclusively with data that was available before this pretended point in time, making forecasts beyond that time point (for which no information was available to the model), and then assessing how close this forecast is to what happened after the pretended time point. When performed correctly, this resolves the both mentioned issues with assessing forecasts truly made into the future:  Since observations after the pretended time point is already available in historic records, assessment can be performed instantaneously, and one can choose several different pretended time points, reducing uncertainty of the estimated prediction skill  and also allowing to see variability in prediction skill across time. </p> <p>To be truly representative of true future use, it is crucial that the pretended time point for forecasting realistically reflects a situation where the future is not known. There are a myriad pitfalls in assessment setup that can lead to the assessment not respecting the principle of future information beyond the pretended time point not being accessible to models. This is discussed in more detail in the document \"Ensuring unbiased and operationally relevant assessments of climate-informed disease forecasting\".</p> <p>Prediction skill can be measured in different ways. One simple way to measure this is to look at how far off the predictions are, on average, from the true values (known as mean absolute error, MAE). Other common measures are discussed later in this tutorial, after we have introduced further aspects of modelling.  To make the most of the data we have, we often use a method called cross-validation. This means we repeatedly split the data into \u201cpast\u201d and \u201cfuture\u201d parts at different time points. We then make forecasts for each split and check how accurate those forecasts are. This helps us see how well the model performs across different periods of time. To learn more, Wikipedia has a broad introduction to this topic, including specifics for time series models. </p> <p>Since we are here running our models through Chap, we can lean on an already implemented solution to avoid pitfalls and ensure a data-efficient and honest evaluation of the models we develop. Chap also includes several metrics, including MAE, and offers several convenient visualisations to provide insights on the prediction skill.  To get a feeling for this, please follow the code-along tutorials on assessment with Chap. We recommend to start with our simple code-along tutorial for how to split data and compute MAE on the pretended future. </p> <p>After getting a feeling for assessment, please continue with our code tutorial on how to use the built-in chap evaluation functionality to perform more sophisticated evaluation of any model (rather than implementing your own simple evaluation from scratch, as in the previous code-along tutorial).</p> <p>With this evaluation setup in place, you should be ready to start looking at more sophisticated modelling approaches. For each new version of your model, evaluation helps you check that the new version is actually an improvement (and if so, in which sense, for instance short-term vs long-term, accuracy vs calibration, large vs small data set).</p>"},{"location":"chap-modeling-platform/external_models/learn_modelling/#expanding-your-model-to-make-it-more-meaningful","title":"Expanding your model to make it more meaningful","text":""},{"location":"chap-modeling-platform/external_models/learn_modelling/#multiple-regions","title":"Multiple regions","text":"<p>While it may in some settings be useful to forecast disease at a national level, it is often more operationally relevant to create forecasts for smaller regions within the country, for instance at district level. Therefore, a disease forecasting approach needs to relate to multiple districts in the code, to create forecasts per district.  If a single model is trained across district data (ignoring the fact that there are different districts) and used to directly forecast disease without taking into account differences between districts in any way, it would forecast similar levels of disease across districts regardless of disease prevalence in each particular district.  To see this more concretely please follow this tutorial to see the errors that the minimalist_example model (which ignores districts) makes for the two districts D1 and D2 with respectively high and low prevalence.</p> <p>The simplest approach to creating meaningful region-level forecast is to simply train and forecast based on a separate model per region. Please follow the tutorial below (in Python or R version) to see an easy way of doing this in code: </p> <ul> <li>Minimalist Multiregion (Python)</li> <li>Minimalist Multiregion (R)</li> </ul> <p>However, such independent consideration of each region also has several weaknesses. A main weakness is connected to the amount of data available to learn a good model. When learning a separate model per region, there may be a scarcity of data to fit a model of the desired complexity. This relates to a general principle in statistics concerning the amount of data available to fit a model versus the number of parameters in a model (see e.g. this article). More available data allows for a larger number of parameters and a more complex model. Compared to the case with separate models per region, just combining data across all regions into a single model where the parameters are completely independent between districts does not change the ratio of available data versus parameters to be estimated. However, if the parameters are dependent (for example due a spatial structure, i.e. similarities between regions), the effective number of parameters will be lower than the actual number. There is a trade-off between having completely independent parameters on one hand and, and forcing parameters to be equal across regions on the other hand. This is often conveyed as \u201cborrowing strength\u201d between regions. It is also related to the concept of the bias-variance tradeoff in statistics and machine learning (see e.g. this Wikipedia article), where dependency between parameter values across regions introduces a small bias in each region towards the mean across regions, while reducing variance of the parameter estimates due to more efficient use of data. </p> <p>As the disease context (including numbers of disease cases) can vary greatly between regions, the same type of model is not necessarily suited for all regions. However, taking this into account can be complex, especially if one wants to combine flexibility of models with the concept of borrowing strength mentioned above. It is thus often more practical to use a single model across regions, but ensure that this model is flexible enough to handle such heterogeneity across regions. </p>"},{"location":"chap-modeling-platform/external_models/learn_modelling/#lags-and-autoregressive-effect","title":"Lags and autoregressive effect","text":"<p>The incidence of disease today is usually affected by the incidence of disease in the recent past. This is for instance almost always the case with infectious disease, whether or not transmission is directly  human-to-human or via a vector like mosquitoes (e.g. Malaria and Dengue). Thus, it is usually advisable to include past cases of disease as a predictor in a model. This is typically referred to as including autoregressive effects in models.</p> <p>Additionally, climate variables such as rainfall and temperature usually don\u2019t have an instantaneous effect. Typically, there is no way that (for example) rainfall today would influence cases today or in the nearest days. Instead, heavy rainfall today could alter standing water, affecting mosquito development and behavior, with effects on reported Malaria cases being several weeks ahead. This means that models should typically make use of past climatic data to predict disease incidence ahead. The period between the time point that a given data value reflects and the time point of its effect is referred to as a lag. The effect of a predictor on disease may vary and even be opposite when considered at different lags. A model should usually include predictors at several different time lags, where the model aims to learn which time lags are important and what the effects are for a given predictor at each such lag.</p> <p>Available data can be on different time resolutions. In some contexts, reported disease cases are available with specific time stamps, but more often what is collected is aggregated and made available at weekly or monthly resolution. The available data resolution influences how precisely variation in predictor effects across lag times can be represented. </p> <p>Basically, the influence of each predictor at each time lag will be represented by a separate parameter in a model. As discussed in the previous section on multiple regions, this can lead to too many parameters to be effectively estimated. It is thus common to employ some form of smoothing of the effects of a predictor across lags, with a reasoning similar to that of borrowing strength across regions (here instead borrowing strength across lag times).</p> <p>At a practical level, model training is often assuming that all predictors to be used for a given prediction (including lagged variables) are available at the same row of the input data table. It is thus common to modify the data tables to make lagged predictors line up. </p> <p>To see a simple way of doing this in code, follow this tutorial in Python or R:</p> <ul> <li>Minimalist Example Lag (Python)</li> <li>Minimalist Example Lag (R)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"chap-modeling-platform/external_models/learn_modelling/#expanding-your-model-with-uncertainty","title":"Expanding your model with uncertainty","text":"<p>Future disease development can never be predicted with absolute certainty - even for short time scales there will always be some uncertainty of how the disease develops. For a decision maker, receiving a point estimate (a single best guess) without any indication of uncertainty is usually not very useful. Consider a best guess of 100 cases in a region. The way to use this information would likely be very different if the model predicted a range from 95 to 105 vs a range from 0 to 10 000. Although the range provided by the model is itself uncertain, it still provides a useful indication of what can be expected, and it will be possible to evaluate its ability to report its own uncertainty (as will be explained in the next section). </p> <p>When doing statistical modelling, uncertainty arises from several distinct sources, many of which are particularly important in time series settings. First, observed data are often noisy or imperfect measurements of an underlying process. Measurement error, reporting delays, missing values, or later data revisions mean that the observed series does not exactly reflect the true system being modelled.</p> <p>Even with perfect observations, the underlying process itself is usually stochastic, meaning that even if one had precise measurements of the current status and had learnt a perfectly correct model that involves these measured data, a variety of external factors would influence disease development in unpredictable ways. Additional uncertainty comes from estimating model parameters (relations between climate and disease) using often limited historical data. This uncertainty propagates into predictions. There is also uncertainty associated with model choice. Any model is a simplification of reality, and incorrect assumptions about lag structure, stationarity, seasonality, or linearity can lead to biased inference and misleading forecasts. This structural uncertainty is difficult to quantify but often dominates in practice.</p> <p>Bayesian modelling provides a way to combine uncertainties from various sources in a coherent, principled way, making sure that the overall uncertainty is well represented. One aspect of this is that instead of estimating one particular value for each of its model parameters (e.g. for the relation between a given climate factor and the disease), it estimates a probability distribution for this value (referred to as the posterior distribution). Uncertainty intervals can then be based on the posterior distribution, for example using the interval between the 5% and 95% quantiles would give an interval with 90% probability of containing the true value of the parameter. Similarly, prediction intervals can be generated for the disease forecasts based on the uncertainty represented in the model itself (in its parameter distributions).</p> <p>Many other modelling approaches (e.g. classical ARIMA and most machine learning models) are mainly focused on the trend of disease development - of predicting a point estimate (single value) for the expected (or most likely) number of disease cases ahead. Uncertainty is then often added on top of this prediction of expected value. A simple choice is to view the model predictions as representing the expected value of some probability distribution that captures the uncertainty of the forecast. For instance, one could view model forecasts as representing the expected value of a normal distribution with a fixed standard deviation that is estimated to capture the uncertainty as well as possible (under such an assumption of normality). Another more sophisticated alternative is to model this standard deviation itself, so that for every forecast, both the expected value and the uncertainty of the forecast is influenced by the available data.</p> <p>Reporting forecasted point estimates is straightforward - it is just to report a single number per region and time period. Reporting a prediction that includes uncertainty is less trivial. If the uncertainty is captured by a given parametric distribution (like a plain normal distribution), one could simply report the parameters of this distribution (the mean and standard deviation in the case of the normal distribution). When uncertainty may follow different distributions, one needs a more flexible approach. One possibility is to report quantiles of this distribution - e.g. the 10% and 90% quantiles, which allows to see a 80% prediction interval. One could also report many of these. An even more generic approach to this is to report samples from the distribution, which allows the full distribution to be approximately reconstructed from the samples. It also allows any quantile to be approximated by simply sorting the samples and finding the value that a given proportion of samples are below. Due to its flexibility, this representation is often the preferred and chosen approach to represent predicted distributions, and is also what is used in the chap models when models report their forecasts back to the platform. </p>"},{"location":"chap-modeling-platform/external_models/learn_modelling/#evaluating-predicted-uncertainty","title":"Evaluating predicted uncertainty","text":"<ul> <li>The concept of uncertainty calibration (and why it is operationally important)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"chap-modeling-platform/external_models/learn_modelling/#honest-and-sophisticated-evaluation-in-more-detail","title":"Honest and sophisticated evaluation in more detail","text":"<ul> <li>(see also separate manuscript about this..)</li> <li>Time series cross-validation..
