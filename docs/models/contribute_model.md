# Promote your climate health modeling research through CHAP

Have you successfully published a scientific paper on climate health modelling and want to broaden the reach of your developed modelling approach? 
If so, the Chap platform is here for you!

## Requirements

- You have a climate health model published in a peer-reviewed journal or conference that includes a DOI for your publication.
- This papers describes a climate-informed model of health or agricultural outcomes that is available as open source codebase in a github repository
- The codebase has been made compatible with Chap (see guide - requires automated installation and defined entry points for training and prediction)

## Benefits

- Your model will be listed on our web pages, with link to your codebase, as well as to your scientific article serving as a description of the model and its capabilities
- Your model will be available to run by anyone having installed Chap, including the many countries that have already set up connections to Chap from their national DHIS2 health information system. Countries can in this way rigorously evaluate the behavior of your model on their own data and may contact you if they have further questions or are considering to use it in operation.
