# Getting Started

The Modeling App connects your DHIS2 health data to CHAP (Climate & Health Modeling Platform) - an open platform for climate-informed disease forecasting.

You probably already see patterns in your data. Cases rise after the rains. Certain districts get hit first. Some months are always worse. The Modeling App takes these patterns and turns them into forecasts - predictions of what's coming, not just descriptions of what happened.

## How it works

Researchers and model developers build predictive models and upload them to your CHAP instance. Your job is to figure out whether those models actually work for your context - and if they do, use them to plan ahead.

The app supports four main workflows:

- **Evaluate** – Test a model against your historical data to see if its predictions are accurate
- **Predict** – Generate forecasts for future time periods
- **Configure** – Adjust model settings to better fit your context
- **Compare** – Run multiple models side-by-side to find what works best

## New to predictive modeling?

2. [Evaluating a model](#/guides/what-is-an-evaluation) – How to test whether a model's predictions can be trusted

If you're already comfortable with the concepts, skip ahead to the user guides to understand how to use the app.
