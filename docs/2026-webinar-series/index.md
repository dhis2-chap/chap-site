# Webinar Series on spatiotemporal modelling with Chap 2026

This webinar series is obligatory preparation for participants attending the DHIS2 workshop on spatiotemporal modelling of climate-sensitive disease in Kigali late February 2026. The webinar series itself is also open to anyone interested, with all resources being openly accessible, and where we will also provide support and follow-up through our Community-of-practice.
