These guides will help you install CHAP, set up a model repository, and make your first model modifications. Work through the guides in order. Each guide has an Exercise section at the end with verification steps.

## [1. Installing CHAP](install-chap.md)

Install the CHAP command-line tool using uv. This tool is required for evaluating and testing your models.

## [2. Fork a Minimalist Example](fork-example.md)

Fork and clone an example model repository. Choose between Python (uv) or R (renv) depending on your preferred language.

## [3. Making Model Alterations](modify-model.md)

Learn the structure of a CHAP-compatible model and make simple modifications to the example code.

## [4. Run Your Model Through CHAP](run-model.md)

Learn how the MLproject file works and run evaluations using the CHAP command-line tool.
