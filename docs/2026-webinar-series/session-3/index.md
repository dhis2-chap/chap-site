# Building your first model

This session is focused on getting you set up with CHAP and make your first model that runs through chap. You will do this by fork an existing minimalist example model repository, make some simple modifications to the model code, and run it through chap.

**Get started:** [1. Installing CHAP](install-chap.md)

These guides will help you install CHAP and set up a model repository. The README in the repository you clone contains instructions for modifying and running your model.

## [1. Installing CHAP](install-chap.md)

Install the CHAP command-line tool using uv. This tool is required for evaluating and testing your models.

## [2. Implement your own model from a minimalist example](fork-example.md)

Fork and clone an example model repository. Choose between Python (uv) or R depending on your preferred language. Then follow the README in the repository for next steps.
