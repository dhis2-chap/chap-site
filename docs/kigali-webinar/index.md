# Kigali Webinar Series

Welcome to the Kigali webinar series documentation. These guides will help you get started with the tools and workflows needed for CHAP model development.

## Guides

### [Terminal Basics](terminal.md)
Learn how to use the command line on Windows (WSL), macOS, and Linux. Essential for running Git commands, installing packages, and using CHAP.

### [Git and GitHub](git-github.md)
Set up Git and GitHub for version control. Learn to fork repositories, clone code, make changes, and push updates.

### [Installation and Virtual Environments](virtual-environments.md)
Learn how to install packages and optionally learn Docker, uv (Python), and renv (R) to create isolated development environments for CHAP models.
