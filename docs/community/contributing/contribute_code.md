# Contributing code

If you want to contribute with code development or model development, a good place to start is the [chap-core github repository](https://github.com/dhis2-chap/chap-core). 

For developers interested in front-end development, the [chap monorepo repository](https://github.com/dhis2-chap/chap-frontend-monorepo) might be more relevant as a starting-point. 

Please read the [documentation](https://dhis2-chap.github.io/chap-core/) before reaching out to us with questions, and feel free to look into any of the [open Github issues](https://github.com/orgs/dhis2-chap/projects/4/views/3). 

We are happy to take code contributions related to these.
