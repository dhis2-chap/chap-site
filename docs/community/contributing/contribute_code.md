# Contributing code

The Chap Platform consists of a number of interrelated codebases, and we are happy to take code contributions related to any of these. Feel free to look into any of the [open Github issues](https://github.com/orgs/dhis2-chap/projects/4/views/3) for easy ways to help out. 

## Chap Core

If you want to contribute with code development or model development, a good place to start is the [chap-core github repository](https://github.com/dhis2-chap/chap-core). 

We have also created a detailed set of guidelines for [how to setup and get started with Chap as a contributor](https://dhis2-chap.github.io/chap-core/contributor/index.html). 

## Modeling App

For developers interested in front-end development, the [chap monorepo repository](https://github.com/dhis2-chap/chap-frontend-monorepo) might be more relevant as a starting-point.
