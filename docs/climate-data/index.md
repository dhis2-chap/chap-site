# Climate Data

The Chap Modeling Platform supports several prediction models that use climate indicators such as precipitation and temperature. The Climate App and Climate Data Tools enable a variety of climate and environmental data sources to be integrated effectively into DHIS2, where data is harmonized into the same organization hierarchy as disease data is stored.
