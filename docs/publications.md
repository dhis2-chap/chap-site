# Openly shared manuscript ideas related to the Chap work

This page lists ideas we have for upcoming papers. We share them here, in order to invite anyone interested to join forces with us to do it together instead of duplicating efforts our field where so much research awaits being done. Many of these are loose ideas, where we are not yet committed, meaning that we have not yet discussed rigorously and performed an (informal) literature review to ensure that the idea appear unique and worthwhile. We invite everyone to join the discussion about whether a manuscript idea appears worthwhile, and if so, what would be a most useful direction ahead. We are very happy to have people join this discussion. Also, if other people already have initiatives or want to drive initiatives related to some of these ideas, we are open to join as contributors in projects led by others.

## [The Climate Health Analysis Platform (Chap): an ecosystem for data, models and analytics connecting climate and health](chap_paper)
A paper that presents the overall platform - its components, its capabilities, its usage modes, and its plans for further continuous development. Should aim for a high profile paper connecting a large number of authors having contributed in a variety of ways. Drawing some peripheral inspiration from https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00413-z .

## [Minimum information and standardized representations for climate-informed disease incidence prediction methods](Minimum_information_paper)
(inspired by e.g. https://www.nature.com/articles/ng1201-365 and https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02206/full)
 
_Stage: 1) loose idea, not yet committed_

## [The spatio-temporally harmonised climate and health database](database_paper)
(inspired by e.g. https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/D1/D339/5144151?login=false, but containing both public data and public metadata descriptions of non-public datasets)

## [Recommended practices for assessing early warnings systems for climate-sensitive health impacts](practices_paper)
Recommendations/standard for how predictive models in the climate health domain should be assessed, in order for these assessments to be trustworthy. It would cover a variety of issues that can introduce biases in the reported performance of assessed methods, as well as aspects that should be considered and reported in order for the reported performance to be sufficiently representative of real scenarios. Based on  general recommendations for time series assessment and specific characteristics of the C&H domain).

## [A broad, reproducible community benchmark for climate-informed water- and vector-borne disease outbreak prediction](benchmark_paper)
Similar aim to the previous paper "An open challenge to advance probabilistic forecasting for dengue epidemics", but including several diseases, a larger number of datasets, and automated prediction (to allow scale and assess capability for operationalisation) in a reproducible manner. Participants would be invited to submit models for a range of settings, for different countries, for several diseases including Malaria and Dengue, with different subsets of available data, and for different prediction setups (e.g. how long ahead to predict).
 
_Stage: 1) loose idea, not yet committed_

## [A toolbox for data aggregation and quality control for climate and health data](toolbox_paper)
A software library that offers a broad range of basic functionality to perform quality control and harmonise climate and health data in space and time. Modelling and visual analytics usually requires climate and health data to be available in corresponding regional and temporal scale. When data are originally available at finer scale, there are many ways to aggregate, and it is thus for the field very useful to have available flexible and robust functionality for such aggregation. In addition, a broad spectrum of basic quantitative analyses are useful to detect data quality issues and should be conveniently available in a library to extend its use.

## [A primer on predictive modelling in the climate and health domain](primer_paper)
Explains the basic relations between climate and health that are investigated through modelling, the specific questions typically being asked including their variations, the data that is typically available and used including their peculiarities and sources, the different ways of presenting/visualising modelling outputs, and finally the ways of assessing predictions.
