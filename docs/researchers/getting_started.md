# Getting Started for Researchers

If you're an epidemiologist with basic R or Python skills, Chap is designed for you. 

!!! note

    Read more about [the benefits and requirements](../models/contribute_model.md) of making your model Chap compatible.

Start with our [minimalist example in R](https://github.com/dhis2-chap/minimalist_example_r/tree/main) and follow our guide to integrate your model into Chap.

You only need to:

1. Read a CSV
2. Output predictions

Chap takes care of the rest â€” validation, tuning, plots, and more.
