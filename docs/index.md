# Chap: Climate & Health Analytics Platform

## The central platform for climate health modeling in the world

Chap (Climate Health Analytics Platform) brings together climate health models into a unified ecosystem, connecting researchers and cutting-edge epidimiological models to policy makers and health practitioners. It makes complex modeling workflows accessible, automates rigorous validation, and integrates directly with DHIS2, the world's leading health information system.

We strive to make all parts of the project development open and transparent, so as to make it as easy as possible to join the CHAP community.

If you are interested in joining this effort, there are several options:

- If you have developed and published a climate and health model, we offer to [help disseminate your model](models/contribute_model.md) and publication on our website and network. 
- If you mainly want to get updates and news about what is happening, please join our [CHAP email list](https://sympa.uio.no/hisp.uio.no/subscribe/chap-updates)
