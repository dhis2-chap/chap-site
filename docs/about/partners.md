# Building an interdisciplinary network for global and local collaboration

To provide the interdisciplinary expertise required for this project, the HISP Centre is partnering with subject matter experts from internationally recognized research groups and global health organizations working at the intersection of climate and health. We have also convened an interdisciplinary working group at the University of Oslo including experts on digitalization, machine learning, data/statistics, health and climate, and are forging partnerships with stakeholders and research partners in LMICs.
