# Roadmap

Chap was developed as part of a [Wellcome-funded project](https://dhis2.org/wellcome-grant-climate-health/) and contingent on a positive evaluation of the initial phase will run from March 2024 to March 2032. Our ambition is that the CHAP codebase grows cumulatively through these years, with continuous updates of new major features, additional integrated models, further supported use cases, increasing country use and not the least with an ever expanding community of software developers, modellers and country implementers that brings overall improvements to the platform as well as a plethora of varied tailorings of the platform to new country and disease contexts.

To understand where CHAP is going, please consult (and get involved with) our fully open [development plans](https://github.com/orgs/dhis2-chap/projects/4) for the weeks ahead, or join our [CHAP email list](https://sympa.uio.no/hisp.uio.no/subscribe/chap-updates) for technical announcements, invitations to webinars, and other project updates.

We also openly provide [our roadmap as a Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AeGUHV8F1LxAZNAcnF3GMCHlcvnsiGnAZCBy20AXfic/edit?gid=497155021#gid=497155021). This is used and continually developed by the core developers of the platform - it is a working document rather than a polished overview, but will hopefully be useful to give an impression of the many ambitions we have for further improvements of the platform. The roadmap is driven by country needs, and especially the prioritisations will thus be continually changing. We are happy to discuss and receive suggestions for new milestones or regarding priorities of milestones already being listed. Also consult the todo-list linked to from the start page for a more fine-grained overview of what we are working on in the near time horison.
