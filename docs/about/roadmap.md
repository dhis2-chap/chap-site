# Roadmap

To understand where Chap is going, please consult (and get involved with) our fully open [development plans](https://github.com/orgs/dhis2-chap/projects/4) for the weeks ahead.

We also openly provide our roadmap as a [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AeGUHV8F1LxAZNAcnF3GMCHlcvnsiGnAZCBy20AXfic/edit?gid=497155021#gid=497155021). This is used and continually developed by the core developers of the platform - it is a working document rather than a polished overview, but will hopefully be useful to give an impression of the many ambitions we have for further improvements of the platform. 

The roadmap is driven by country needs, and especially the prioritisations will thus be continually changing. We are happy to discuss and receive suggestions for new milestones or regarding priorities of milestones already being listed.
