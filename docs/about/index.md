# What is Chap? 

> *Chap is a DHIS2-integrated platform that aims to make climate and health modeling and forecasting easier, better, and more impactful.*

The Chap modeling platform combines health data in national DHIS2 systems with climate, weather, and environmental data from a variety of sources to run and compare predictive models and power early warning systems that are both locally customizable and scalable across disease programs and countries. 

In addition to integrating seamlessly with DHIS2 systems, Chap is intended to be available as generic software that climate and health stakeholders and researchers can use to run and assess their models using global and local climate and health data.

Chap was developed as part of a [Wellcome-funded project](https://dhis2.org/wellcome-grant-climate-health/) and contingent on a positive evaluation of the initial phase will run from March 2024 to March 2029. 

The project is coordinated by the HISP network at the University of Oslo, but is organised as a collaborative project where we invite contributions by everyone interested in joint development of data processing, machine learning and software to advance the field of climate and health analytics. 

The Chap platform is developed as part of the broader [DHIS2 for Climate & Health](https://dhis2.org/climate/) project for strengthening climate-resilient health systems.
