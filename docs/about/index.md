# What is Chap? 

Chap was initiated in March 2024 and is coordinated by the HISP network at the University of Oslo, but is organised as a collaborative project where we invite contributions by everyone interested in joint development of data processing, machine learning and software to advance the field of climate and health analytics. 

Our mission statement:

The Chap platform is developed as part of the broader [DHIS2 for Climate & Health](https://dhis2.org/climate/) project for strengthening climate-resilient health systems.
